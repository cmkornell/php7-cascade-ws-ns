# php7-cascade-ws-ns
My Cascade web service library, using namespaces, written in PHP 7. Last modified: Aug 30, 2016, 9:50 AM
<p>This version of the library makes use of features in PHP7. Since I have just started making changes,
most files are identical to those in the older version. Everything is posted here so that the library 
constantly remains complete with all new features I am adding, and users can use this version to
take advantage of the new features. I expect that this upgrade process will last for at least a few months.</p>

<p>Phase 1: adding type information to the library and reworking the test code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Asset and associated test code</li>
</ul>
